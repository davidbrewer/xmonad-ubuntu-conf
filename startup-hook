# On login, we unlock the ssh keychain so we're not prompted for 
# passphrases later. We pipe /dev/null to ssh-add to make it realize 
# it's not running in a terminal. Otherwise, it won't launch the prompt.

# If you don't use the ssh keychain you may not want this. Commented
# by default as it is assumed many users will not want this feature.

# I disable the middle mouse button because otherwise I constantly

# Note that the id of the mouse device may be different depending on 
# which usb port it is plugged into! To find it, use:
# xinput list |grep 'id='
# In the following command, the id is the first argument, the rest is 
# the remapping.
